Autoformat numbers to show thousand separators as delimiters.
See that form fields with css classes can autoformat number. 
Just add css class="numberformat currency" to a text field, and it will be formatted automatically.

This code is open so you could add more behaviour later. For instance add more formatters (not only currency).

TODO: Add more formatters (not only currency)
TODO: Make thousand/decimal delimiters globally modifiable so that the js file does not have to be changed
      in a project.
